## General info

This project is a fictional board game club website I created as part of my codecademy course. The inspiration came from board games I have been playing recently. The initial scope was to creare a responsive website using Grid or flexbox, and I opted for Grid as my last project used flexbox. The website has media queries set for mobile, tablet and desktop and should scale. To make the project a bit more intresting and take advantage if grid-auto-flow, I created a search bar and filter function which filters events by name or catogory.
